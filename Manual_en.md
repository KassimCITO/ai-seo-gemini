## How is the SEO slug generated?

The plugin automatically creates SEO-friendly slugs (URLs) optimized for local SEO using these rules:

1. The slug is based on the title generated by Gemini, normalized to lowercase and only letters, numbers, and hyphens.
2. If the main keyword (focus keyword) is not at the beginning, it is prepended to the slug.
3. Common Spanish stopwords (e.g., de, la, y, en, para, etc.) are removed for cleaner, more relevant slugs.
4. The slug is limited to a maximum of 8 words.
5. Words that are dates (years, months, days, single numbers) are removed.
6. If the slug already exists in another post, an incremental suffix is added to ensure uniqueness.

**Visual example:**

Suppose the generated title is:
    "Noticias de la Feria de Apatzingán en julio 2024"
and the main keyword is:
    "feria apatzingan"

The resulting slug will be:
    feria-apatzingan-noticias

If it already exists, it will be:
    feria-apatzingan-noticias-2

This way you get a clean, relevant, and locally optimized SEO URL.

## Automatic redirections after slug change

When the plugin modifies a post slug, if the Rank Math Redirections module is active, a 301 redirect from the old URL to the new one is created automatically. This ensures that visitors and search engines do not encounter errors and your SEO is preserved.

You do not need to do anything manually: the redirection is handled transparently.
